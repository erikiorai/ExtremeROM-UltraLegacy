# EOL
### End Of Life
# everything I had done in this project has failed.
### I have now stopped the support for this project for now.

## If you are interested in something similar feel free to check out ProjectNERV by Yagzie or ExtremeROM by ExtremeXT.
## I might continue this Project in the future once I feel experienced enough.
### I will soon make a similar repo but based on NERV or UNICA for different devices
##### If you managed to get a device to boot feel free tho pm me on xda (Android-Artisan) or discord (Android_Artisan) so I transfer the repo to you!

# What is ReNote-Rom?
ReNote-Rom is a work-in-progress custom firmware for Samsung Galaxy devices with exynos 9810 chips. It's based on the latest and greatest iteration of Samsung's UX and it also includes additional features and tweaks to ensure the best possible experience out of the box.
It is based on the UN1CA build system which allows automatic downloading/extraction of the firmware, applying the required patches and generating a flashable zip/tar package for the specified target device.
ReNote-Rom will support the Note9/Note10 Lite/S9/S9+ running an Exynos 9810 SoC

Any form of contribution, suggestions, bug report or feature request for the project will be welcome.
